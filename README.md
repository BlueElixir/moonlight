# IMPORTANT

## information

For information regarding the project (release dates, download links, etc), please join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XCpTmK8DAw) or check the [Website](https://www.blueelixir.xyz/).

Any other official sources of information, including, but not limited to, the aimware forum and this GitHub repository, will link directly to the aforementioned sources.



## auto-updater

The v1.0.0 release of moonlight will have an auto-updater built in. For information on how to disable it (to modify the script so it fits your own needs) please contact me on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XCpTmK8DAw). Please understand, that script modifications made on older versions will not automatically be ported over and might require additional work to implement.

This will download the latest patch, minor and major versions (x.y.z, where x is the major, y is the minor and z is the patch version) and apply them automatically. The new script name will not contain version information; the version information will be found in the menu and in the console after loading the script.
